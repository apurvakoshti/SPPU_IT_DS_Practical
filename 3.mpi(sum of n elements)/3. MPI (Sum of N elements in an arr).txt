3. MPI (Sum of N elements in an array)

Step 1: Go to the MPJ-express on chrome and download the latest version of it in the form of zip.
Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpjexpress/

Step 2: Extract the mpj zip on the windows C by creating a folder of mpj in it.

Step 3: Set up the environment variables.
        Open Environment Variables:

        Press Win + S → search for Environment Variables

        Click on “Edit the system environment variables”

        Click Environment Variables

        Add MPJ_HOME variable:

        Click New (under System variables)

        Variable name: MPJ_HOME

        Variable value: C:\mpj

        Edit Path variable:

        Select Path under System variables → Click Edit

        Click New → Add:

        C:\mpj\bin

Step 4 : javac -cp "C:\mpj\lib\mpj.jar" Sum.java

Step 5: C:\mpj\bin\mpjrun.bat -np 2  Sum

If there are 2 processes, each will handle 5 elements, so the total data size is 5 * 2 = 10 elements (as defined by unitsize * size).
