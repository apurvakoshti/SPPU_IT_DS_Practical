Step 1: First download the jdk 8 with email-apurvakoshti2608@gmail.com and password-ApurvaSK@26
Step 2: Download it in the other drive than C, by creating folder in it named Java.
It should look like Local Disk D/E/Java/jdk/bin

-Do not install the jre for it because it is already been present there

-Add environment variables in the  system variable with JAVA_HOME as D:\Java\jdk
and in path add as full path as D:\Java\jdk\bin

The main three files we need to write is client.java, Server.java, PallindromeString.idl, PallindromeImpl.java and other will get generated by the steps

Copy paste the code there
and in the terminal run the command first to check version of idlj -version


-In first terminal run 
Step 1: Run the command as :  idlj -fall PallindromeString.idl
Step 2: The folder will be generated then compile all the files present in the folder as: javac *.java PallindromeStringApp/*.java
 or javac PallindromeString/*.java
Step 3: javac -cp . Server.java
Step 4: javac -cp . Client.java
Step 5: orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050 

-In second terminal
Step 1: java -cp . Server -ORBInitialPort 1050

-In third terminal
Step 1: java -cp . Client -ORBInitialPort 1050
and keep running this to check pallindrome
