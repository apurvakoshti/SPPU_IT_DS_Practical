Web services are software applications that allow different systems to communicate with each other over the Internet using standard protocols (like HTTP).
They let machines talk to each other â€” regardless of their programming languages or platforms.

âœ… Example: A weather app fetching data from a weather server using a web service.

ðŸ§© Main Features of Web Services:
Interoperable (can run on different systems/languages)

ðŸ“š Types of Web Services:
1. SOAP Web Services (Simple Object Access Protocol)

2. RESTful Web Services (Representational State Transfer)
Uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Returns data in JSON or XML.

Lightweight, faster, and easier to use.

Common in mobile and web applications.
